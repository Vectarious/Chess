# Chess
A playable chess program with console GUI, I hope you enjoy playing!

## Implementation
* The program can determine legal moves based on whose turn it is, the piece being moved, if there are pieces in the way, if castling is legal, etc.
* All standard chess rules are implemented (except en passant, still a work in progress)!
* Graphics are created using colored spaces and ascii characters: ♖ ♘ ♗ ♕ ♔ ♙

## For The User (how to move)
* To play a game using program, imput moves to the console in the form "initial_square-final_square", (for example, "e2-e4")
* If the move is invalid, the system will let you know so you can try again
* To castle, use "o-o" for kingside and "o-o-o" for queenside—the system will keep track of whether castling is legal on each side throughout the game!

Have fun!
